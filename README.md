# The Control System for Quantum Information Process in Ion Traps

>Updated on June 30, 2020
The frequency reading of wave length meters has been added


Experimental operations of a single qubit in an ion trap can be realized by this project, including a designed GUI and functions of rabi scan, zeeman scan, and pulse shaping for the DDS (generated by AWG).

## 2. Usage

### 1. Installing Artiq5 for Windows Users

1. Come to the link of script: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-labs/artiq/release-5/install-with-conda.py> , copy all the script.
2. Create a new python file on your desktop, copy the script into the file.  Name it with `artiq_script.py`
3. Command Prompt:  `$ python artiq_script.py `
4. After minutes, packages Artiq5 will be installed in your PC.



### 2. Preparing

1. Creating a new folder, name it with `Artiq_WIPM`.
2. Create a new folder called `repository` inside `Artiq_WIPM`.
3. Copy the file `device_db.py` into the `Artiq_WIPM`. This file should be given by M-Labs guys.
4. Click the button ' Clone or download ' of this project.
5. Click ' Download ZIP '.
6. Uncompress the .zip file, copy the folder `repository` to recover the same name folder in `Artiq_WIPM`.
7. Command Prompt:

    `$ activate artiq  `

    `$ cd \Artiq_WIPM`

    `$ artiq_main`

8. Turn on another Command Prompt:

    `$ activate artiq`

    `$ artiq_dashboard`





### 3. Getting Start

1. Go to the ' Explorer ' part in dashboard, click the ' GUIFinal ' operation, set the pipeline to 'GUI', then click ' Submit ' button.

2. GUI will come out, change parameters (Rabi Scan/Zeeman Scan/...) , select one choice in ' Selection ' part, then Click ' Submit '.

3. Go to the ' Explorer ' part in dashboard, select the ' Run ' operation, then click ' Submit ' button.

4. After opreation done, photon count picture will appear at Applet.
