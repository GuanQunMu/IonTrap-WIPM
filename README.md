# The Control System for Quantum Information Process in Ion Traps

>Updated on July 02, 2020  
The frequency reading of lasers has been added  
The communication between Artiq and another PC with HighFinesse WLM has been added


Experimental operations of a single qubit in an ion trap can be realized by this project, including a designed GUI and functions of rabi scan, zeeman scan, and pulse shaping for the DDS (generated by AWG).

## 1. Introduction

<img src="/Pictures/GUI2.1.png" width="100%">

ARTIQ was initiated by the Ion Storage Group at NIST. Based on this, we developed the control system for quantum information process in ion traps. It can support rabi scan, zeeman scan and paulse shaping for DDS. Furthermore, We developed a GUI and attached AWG (Arbitrary waveform generator) and the data from wave length meter with this control system.

## 2. Usage

### 1. Installing Artiq5 for Windows Users

1. Go to this link: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-labs/artiq/release-5/install-with-conda.py> , copy all the script.
2. Create a new python file, Paste the script in the file.  Name it with `artiq_script.py`
3. Command Prompt:  `$ python artiq_script.py `
4. After few minutes, the packages of Artiq5 will be installed.



### 2. Preparing

1. Download this project, Uncompress it.

2. Replace the initial 'device_db.py' with the latest 'device_db.py' in the folder. Then Change the IP data in the 'device_db.py' to the IP of the Artiq hardware. (If you have not bought the hardware from M-Labs, just skip it)

3. Command Prompt:

    `$ activate artiq  `

    `$ cd \Artiq_WIPM`

    `$ artiq_master`

4. Then turn on another Command Prompt:

    `$ activate artiq`

    `$ artiq_dashboard`

5. Now the dashboard of Artiq should appear. It is remarkable that if you skip the procedure2, you may not succeed to connect the hardware of Artiq, but you can still run codes without @kernel.



### 3. Getting Start

1. Find the ' Explorer ' part in the dashboard, double click the latest ' GUI ' operation, set the pipeline to 'GUI', then click ' Submit ' button.

2. After the GUI appears, change parameters (Rabi Scan/Zeeman Scan/...) and select a running mode, then click thhe 'Submit' botton on the GUI.

3. double click the latest ' Run ' operation in the ' Explorer ' part, set the pipeline to 'main', then click ' Submit ' button.
